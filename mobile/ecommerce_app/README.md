## Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust e-commerce application using Flutter. The project adheres to Clean Architecture, which promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase easier to test and maintain.

## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture, dividing the project into distinct layers, each with its specific responsibilities:

### Domain Layer

The domain layer is the core of the application. It contains business logic that is independent of any frameworks or external systems. This layer includes:

-   **Entities**: Core business objects that are used throughout the application.
-   **Use Cases**: Business rules that define what operations can be performed in the application. They interact with the repository interfaces defined within the domain.

### Data Layer

The data layer is responsible for managing the application's data. It interacts with databases, file systems, and other sources of data, providing an abstraction over these systems. This layer includes:

-   **Models**: These are data structures that represent the objects within your application. They often mirror the structure of your database tables and are used to organize data in a way that is easy to work with in your code.
-   **Repositories**: These are interfaces defined within the domain layer and implemented in the data layer. They provide methods for accessing and manipulating data.
-   **Data Sources**: These are the actual sources of data, such as databases or files. They are used by the repositories to fulfill their functions.

To interact with the data layer, the use cases defined in the domain layer use the repository interfaces. This ensures that the domain layer remains independent of the specific data sources used.
